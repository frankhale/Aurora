Aurora - An MVC web framework for .NET 

Frank Hale <frankhale@gmail.com>

Date: 6 August 2012

// --------------------
// --- Feature List ---
// --------------------
//
// - Model View Controller based 
// - Front controller aware (optional)
// - Simple tag based view engine with master pages and partial views as well as
//   fragments 
// - URL parameters bind to action method parameters automatically 
// - Posted forms binds to post models or action parameters automatically 
// - Actions can have bound parameters that are bound to actions at runtime
// - Actions can be segregated based on Get, Post, Put and 
//   Delete action type and you can secure them with the Secure named parameter.
//   Actions without a designation will not be invoked from a URL.
// - Actions can have filters with optional filter results that bind to action
//   parameters.  
// - Actions can have aliases. Aliases can also be added dynamically at runtime
//   along with default parameters.
// - Bundling/Minifying of Javascript and CSS.
//
// Aurora.Extra 
//
// - My fork of Massive ORM
// - HTML helpers
// - Plugin support (can be used by apps but is not integrated at all into the
//   framework pipeline.)
// - OpenID authentication which is as easy as calling two methods. One 
//   to initiate the login with the provider and then one to finalize 
//   authentication.
// - Active Directory querying so you can authenticate your user against an 
//   Active Directory user. Typically for use in client certificate 
//   authentication.
//
// Aurora.Misc
//
// - My fork of the Gravatar URL generator
//
 
Changelog:

6 August 2012

- Code cleanup

3 August 2012

- Minor code enhancements and cleanup

2 August 2012

- After the view engine loads the templates and compiles them the results are
  cached to disk in a single jsonified file. Restarts of the app pool or 
  cassini development server will use the cached results instead of loading 
  all the templates and compiling them again.
- Action Filters have access to the current user and LogOn and LogOff methods.
- Code cleanup.

1 August 2012

- Code cleanup! The name of the game is code refinement, no new feature adds,
  just trying to get everything totally working as advertised!

- Minor code tweaks

30 July 2012

- Some code cleanup and tweaks
- Controllers now get a copy of the request dictionary

  routes and RemoveRoute will now properly dispose of them when called.

26 July 2012

- Condensed all the Http request attributes into a single Http attribute
- Did some work on the BaseController/Controller and FrontController events
- The OnCheckRoles event actually gets called now
- Miscellaneous code cleanup

25 July 2012

- Code cleanup
- Added Aurora.Misc which is for stuff that doesn't fit in Aurora.Extra 
  (eg. stuff that is on the fringe like my Gravatar fork and that wont' be 
   all that useful to most people)

24 July 2012

- Bug fixing!

23 July 2012

- Action Filters are back in
- Bug fix for [FromRedirectOnly] actions
- Code cleanup

21 July 2012

- Aurora.cs has been totally rewritten from scratch:

   AspNetAdapter.cs - Interface to ASP.NET
   Aurora.cs - Core web framework
   Aurora.Extra.cs - Everything else

   TODO: Documentation has been ripped out, it will be replaced, for now there
        is nothing. I'll be uploading a sample application soon. Also the only
        feature that is not back in the rewrite is Action Filters. I'm working
        on that.
