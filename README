// --------------------
// --- Feature List ---
// --------------------
//
// - Model View Controller based 
// - Front controller aware (optional)
// - Simple tag based view engine with master pages and partial views as well as
//   fragments 
// - URL parameters bind to action method parameters automatically 
// - Posted forms binds to post models or action parameters automatically 
// - Actions can have bound parameters that are bound to actions at runtime
// - Actions can be segregated based on HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpPut and 
//   HttpDelete attributes and you can secure them with the Secure named 
//   parameter. Actions without a designation will not be invoked from a URL.
// - Actions can have filters with optional filter results that bind to action
//   parameters.  
// - Actions can have aliases. Aliases can also be added dynamically at runtime
//   along with default parameters.
// - Actions can be invoked on a special basis if they are designated with the
//   [FromRedirectOnly] attribute.
// - Bundling/Minifying of Javascript and CSS.
//
// Aurora.Extra 
//
// - My fork of Massive ORM
// - My fork of the Gravatar URL generator
// - HTML helpers
// - Plugin support (can be used by apps but is not integrated at all into the
//   framework pipeline.)
// - OpenID authentication which is as easy as calling two methods. One 
//   to initiate the login with the provider and then one to finalize 
//   authentication.
// - Active Directory querying so you can authenticate your user against an 
//   Active Directory user. Typically for use in client certificate 
//   authentication.
